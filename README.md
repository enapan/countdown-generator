### Examples

#### Weekend Countdown

In this example, the weekend starts on Friday at 17:00... just adapt the URL parameters as needed.

https://stefanholzmueller.github.io/countdown-generator/index.html?event=WEEKEND&prefix=Weekend%20starts%20in&type=weekly&startDayOfWeek=5&hour=17&minute=0&second=0

This countdown repeats every week.

#### Wedding Countdown

This countdown uses a fixed date and time:

https://stefanholzmueller.github.io/countdown-generator/index.html?event=WEDDING%20DAY&prefix=Wedding%20starts%20in&type=fixed&year=2018&month=6&day=23&hour=13&minute=0&second=0

## TODO

A page where the countdown can be configured, instead of editing URL parameters.
